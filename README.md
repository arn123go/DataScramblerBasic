It is forked from [LearnWithHasinHayder/DataScrambler](https://github.com/LearnWithHasinHayder/DataScrambler).

1. It shows how to achieve the same objective using PHP only or JavaScript only or both.

2. When changing program mode from "'JavaScript' or 'Both'" to 'PHP', an issue emerges regarding the staticness of url as JavaScript does everything here on the client side. This issue was handled here so that an smooth transition happens while shifting modes.

3. The folder or directory named 'scrambler' above contains all the files of the project which I have extended or modified. You may simply download that folder only to try the project.
